            </div>The K3s Cluster No, your eyes do not deceive you. This is a very similarly named blog to our Powerful Single Node RKE2 on Hetzner for CHEAP! (Part 1).
Some folks don&rsquo;t want to deploy RKE2, and we don&rsquo;t want you to feel left out. In this blog we are going to deploy K3s in place of RKE2.
If you want to see why we chose Hetzner for this specific deployment, go check out the previous blog.]]></description>

            </div>What is Rancher Multi-Cluster Management If you have ventured into container management and Kubernetes for your organization (or even for yourself), you have quickly realized that you need a robust way to manage more than one cluster easily. In fact, you probably want an easier way to manage a single cluster.
The official Kubernetes dashboard is&hellip; sub-optimal. There are a few other open-source options out there, but they lack in many areas.]]></description>

            </div>Why We Use Rancher Ok, let&rsquo;s get this out of the way. Yes, we are a Rancher Gold Partner and yes, we provide Rancher Training.
We are not those things because we are corpo shills. We partnered with Rancher because we use their products anyway.
  We use them in production (RKE2 and K3s).
  We use them on our Raspberry Pi clusters (K3s).
  We use them in Docker (K3d)]]></description>
