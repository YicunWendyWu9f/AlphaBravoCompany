Given our regular use of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, we reviewed the options available and found Glue Databrew. Glue Databrew is a visual data preparation tool which allows for easy cleaning and normalization of data in preparation for use with analytics and machine learning. The engineering team discovered we could easily upload a dataset, create repeatable recipes for our ETL purposes, and save our results to a database or S3 bucket.

During our discovery phase, we also researched Apache’s Nifi. Much like AWS Glue Databrew, Apache Nifi provides a visual data preparation tool to clean and normalize data. Using a series of processors, Nifi can extract data from multiple sources, create multiple workflows for ETL purposes, and save the results to a database or S3 bucket. The stand-out feature for Nifi, as compared to AWS, is its ability to allow AlphaBravo to be platform agnostic, whereas Databrew is hard wired into the AWS ecosystem. Nifi also scales exceptionally well and is incredibly fast. What Databrew Does Well During our testing with Databrew, we discovered that the interface is incredibly simple to understand and use. The engineering team were able to create multiple workflow samples within a day, and by the end of day two, we were able to ingest multiple data samples, perform ETL work, merge all of the results into a single dataset, and load the results into an S3 bucket or database. Given that Databrew is a part of the AWS ecosystem, it’s trivial to automate against the platform using multiple toolsets. The AWS CLI works exceptionally well, as does the SDK toolsets, such as the BOTO SDK for Python. Using these tools, we were able to get Databrew completely integrated into our automation pipeline within a few days. Using the UI, the team was able to build easy to use recipes, which we could apply to our sample datasets and return the same result time and time again, as long as the dataset matched the expectations of the recipe. Once we had agreed upon the recipes for our sample datasets, we were able to use these recipes to create jobs with associated datasets to perform the ETL workload. Overall, from start to finish the process rarely took over a few minutes to complete.

We reached out to support to see what we could do to solve these problems, however we were informed that the only way to solve the issue would be to build in logic to throttle API calls over time to prevent the timeout from occurring.

Nifi easily integrates with many cloud platforms and service providers, providing simple methods to extract data. It can query and load many different database platforms, message queues, email, APIs, streaming services, logs, ftp, etc. And if you cannot find a processor to fit your needs, you can create your own and import it into the service. Once data has been pulled into the platform, Nifi can easily transform the data and move it along in different workflows. For example, I can pull a JSON document from a message queue, extract the information contained in the file to set one or more attributes, create a flowfile using the attributes, deduplicate and sort the information in the flowfile, merge the contents into a new CSV file, and store the newly created CSV file into an S3 bucket. Did I mention Nifi is fast? It can do all of the work mentioned above in less than a second. In testing, the AphaBravo engineering team has thrown significant amounts of data at Nifi and has been able to retrieve data within a second or two.

There have been several instances during the POC where a processor was introduced and experienced failures because the documentation was not very clear to the expectations of work. As an example, database integration can be tricky to set up. A user must first find the related processor, for example, “ExecuteSQL”. In order to use this processor, a database connection pooling service must be assigned. If this controller service does not yet exist, it must be created and configured. When setting up the controller service for the database connection pool, you must know the following: The database connection URL: Not only do you need the URL itself, but you must use the exact syntax required by your DBMS. Example: jdbc:mysql://mydatabase:3306 The database driver class name: The name of the driver class to use for connectivity. This is usually provided via the database documentation, and isn’t referenced in the Nifi documentation. Example: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver The location of the database driver on the host node: Generally, the driver is not installed with Nifi. You must download the driver, upload it to the hosted node(s), extract the driver, and store it in a directory which Nifi can access.

In fact, you probably want an easier way to manage a single cluster. The official Kubernetes dashboard is… sub-optimal. There are a few other open-source options out there, but they lack in many areas. So what are we supposed to do? # Rancher has entered the chat. This is where the Rancher UI, or Rancher Multi-Cluster Manager (Rancher MCM) comes into play. As engineers responsible for a plethora of technologies, even just drilling down into Kubernetes space we usually have: A local Kubernetes cluster (k3d, k3s on a Raspberry Pi, or similar) 1-2 Dev clusters 1-N Test, QA, etc clusters 1-N Production clusters On each of those clusters we need: Monitoring \u0026 Alerting Logging Backups Direct access to Pod console and logs Simplified deployment capabilities (Helm, etc) into each Quick view into the health of the cluster Much more This presents a problem because our time is already fragmented enough.

Yes, we are a Rancher Gold Partner and yes, we provide Rancher Training. We are not those things because we are corpo shills. We partnered with Rancher because we use their products anyway. We use them in production (RKE2 and K3s). We use them on our Raspberry Pi clusters (K3s). We use them in Docker (K3d) And we manage it all with the Rancher UI. So what are some of the reasons why we use Rancher? The products are open source. At AlphaBravo we love Open Source technology and companies that find a way to open source their technology and still provide immense value beyond that open source project. Secure (or at least securable with minimal configuration tweaks). There are varying “out of the box” security settings across the product line, but Rancher does a great job of focusing on differentiating in each area (K3s vs RKE2 for example). Simple to deploy. This is a big one. As engineers who need to do our full-time jobs while also keeping track of the latest technology, it is important to be able to quickly deploy and assess new technologies is critical. With Rancher software and some basic Linux knowledge and some Linux systems around, you can deploy many of their products including a functioning Kubernetes cluster with a SINGLE CLI COMMAND. Let that sink in. Easy to use. When it is 2 AM and you are troubleshooting a production micro-service issue, you definitely need this as a feature. (Shout out to my Pager Duty crew.) I am obviously kidding. We should all be striving to expand our technical capabilities, play well with others, and operate as one big Dev and Ops family. Breaking down the silos and sharing our knowledge is what makes us stronger as a team. Rancher certainly assists in that mission. I mean, have you SEEN the sheer number of open-source products they have? Rancher UI - The Enterprise Kubernetes Management Platform. Rancher is a complete platform for managing Kubernetes clusters wherever you deploy them. RKE - RKE is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It solves the common frustration of installation complexity with Kubernetes by removing most host dependencies and presenting a stable path for deployment, upgrades, and rollbacks. RKE2 - RKE2, also known as RKE Government, is Rancher’s next-generation Kubernetes distribution. It is a fully conformant Kubernetes distribution that focuses on security and compliance within the U.S. Federal Government sector. K3s is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances. K3os - k3OS is purpose-built to simplify Kubernetes operations in low-resource computing environments. Installs fast. Boots faster. Managed through Kubernetes. k3d - k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Lab’s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker. k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes. Longhorn - Longhorn is a lightweight, reliable, and easy-to-use distributed block storage system for Kubernetes. Longhorn is free, open-source software. Originally developed by Rancher Labs, it is now being developed as an incubating project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Fleet - Fleet is GitOps at scale. Fleet is designed to manage up to a million clusters. It’s also lightweight enough that it works great for a single cluster too, but it really shines when you get to a large scale. By large scale, we mean either a lot of clusters, a lot of deployments, or a lot of teams in a single organization.
