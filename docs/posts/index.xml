            </div>Why We Use Rancher Ok, let&rsquo;s get this out of the way. Yes, we are a Rancher Gold Partner and yes, we provide Rancher Training.
We are not those things because we are corpo shills. We partnered with Rancher because we use their products anyway.
  We use them in production (RKE2 and K3s).
  We use them on our Raspberry Pi clusters (K3s).
  We use them in Docker (K3d)]]></description>

            </div>Welcome To The Blog We are excited to have you here.
As Technology enthusiast with a broad range of experiences, we hope to convey some tales, some tech, and some thoughts around the current state of DevSecOps.
Our focus is mainly on building robust platforms using open-source software. But don&rsquo;t be confused if we talk about non-open source software too. We are a small team and we understand very well that sometimes you need a product or tool that &ldquo;just works&rdquo;.]]></description>
