# Welcome To The Blog

We are excited to have you here.

As technology enthusiasts with a broad range of experiences, we hope to convey some tales, some tech, and some thoughts around the current state of DevSecOps.

Our focus is mainly on building robust platforms using open-source software. But don't be confused if we talk about non-open source software too. We are a small team and we understand very well that sometimes you need a product or tool that "just works". 

While we provide technology services in staff augmentation, deployment acceleration, and training, we also are building some cool internal tools that we hope to release to the community soon.

Thanks for checking us out and we look forward to hearing your feedback on what we post here.
